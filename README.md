Shelfless by Bring plugin integrates Bring's Mybring and Shelfless solutions with your WooCommerce store.

## Description ##

Shelfless by Bring for WooCommerce plugin integrates Bring's Mybring and Shelfless solutions to WooComerce. Shelfless by Bring for WooComerce enables the integration of your WooCommerce store to Bring's Mybring and Shelfless services, wherein you will have the ability to fulfill and ship the orders through Bring's warehouses straight from your WooCommerce store's administrative interface.

This plugin needs an account from Bring, such as Mybring Customer ID and API Key, in order to work. You may get these details from your MyBring account or from a Bring executive handling your account. Additionally, a Shelfless API key has to be set up for you by your account executive. If you have no Shelfless account yet, you may reach us through <a href="https://www.bring.com/customer-service">Bring Customer Service</a> and we will be glad to process it for you.

This plugin will use two Bring APIs:

- <a href="https://www.bring.no/radgivning/netthandel/shelfless">Shelfless by Bring Fulfillment Services APIs</a> - the Shelfless API services used exclusively by Bring's developers in creating official Bring solutions such as Shelfless by Bring for WooComerce.
- <a href="https://developer.bring.com/">Bring Integration APIs, such as the Shipping Guide API</a> - the general integrations APIs used by third-party developers for integrating with ecommerce sites and logistics software.
